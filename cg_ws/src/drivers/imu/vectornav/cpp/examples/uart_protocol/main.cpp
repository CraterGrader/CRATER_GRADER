	// This example provides an overview of the UART protocol functionality

	// Using the UART Protocol allows communicating with a VectorNav sensor
	// over a UART interface using both ASCII and binary protocols. Usage of
	// just the UART Protocol features without the VnSensor object requires you
	// to do all of the grunt work of initializing and managing the UART port
	// for your development environment. Once this is setup, you will
	// initialize the UART protocol and then simply pass arrays of data between
	// your UART code and the VectorNav C++ Library's protocol code. To keep
	// this example generic, we will mock the necessary UART initialization and
	// management functions that would need to be replaced by code specific for
	// your environment to tie into a real VectorNav sensor. For now we just
	// use some fake data to illustrate the process.

	// The Protocol structure encapsulates the data used for buffering and
	// handling incoming data. It is not associated with sending commands to
	// the sensor. This will be illustrated further in the example.
